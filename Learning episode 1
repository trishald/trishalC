What is Github?
github is an online repository where we can store our codes, code snippets and project related data. Its mainly used for version control if the repository is a public repository. version control means, if two or more people are working on a project, the team members can update the code with their code and commit it. commit is something like save. The history of commits will be saved and wrong commits can be reset by the owner of the repository.
